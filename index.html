            <p>Iron Man is one of the most popular superheroes to come from Marvel comics, with no small part being due
                to the movie portrayal by Robert Downey, Jr. The fan-favorite Avenger has only shown romance with Pepper
                Potts on the big screen. While movie fans may be familiar with that relationship, there is more to the
                story in the comics.</p>
